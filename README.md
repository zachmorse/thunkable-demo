Thunkable Demo App.

hosted [here](https://thunkable-demo.surge.sh/)

# How to run project
```
git clone https://github.com/zachmorse/thunkable-demo.git
cd thunkable-demo && npm install && npm start
```

## Things I implemented:
- Create, rename, delete functionality
- Redux
- MUI v5 (not required but I wanted to adjust from v4)

## Things I'd like to implement
- Use local storage to hydrate redux state if user navigates away
- button to decline project creation (currently you always have to make one)
