Thunkable Demo App.

hosted [here](https://thunkable-demo.surge.sh/)

# How to run project
```
git clone https://github.com/zachmorse/thunkable-demo.git
cd thunkable-demo && npm install && npm start
```

## Things I implemented:
- Create, rename, delete functionality
- Responsive design
- Redux
- MUI v5 (not required but I wanted to adjust from v4)

## Future implementation ideas
- Use local storage to hydrate Redux state if user navigates away
- Button to decline project creation (currently you always have to make one) 
- Theme object for global style constants
- drag and drop using [Framer Motion](https://www.framer.com/motion/reorder/)
